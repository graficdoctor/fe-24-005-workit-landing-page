## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to do the curves underneath the sections. That did my head in first time I started this exercise. Which seems to be about 6 months ago. I went back to the code this week and had an indepth refactoring, adding in updates to how I currently write my css. Which is by using more utility-classes.
It was interesting to see the development I made in these 6 months.

### Useful resources

- [Custom Shape Dividers](https://www.shapedivider.app/) - The tool I used to create the curved end of the header. I found this tool via the tutorial video for this exercise, by [Practical Web Dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkgKIOTgvCI)
